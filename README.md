# Ask Apps Tech Classes - Session 4

### Summary:
In this exercise, you will build a React VR application that allows us to view a video and has a panoramic view of a movie theater. 

The necessary structure for the application has already been provided, but there are several parts of the application logic and styling that don't work yet.

No HTML changes are required to complete this exercise. The goal is to focus on React prop passing and styling in 3D space.
